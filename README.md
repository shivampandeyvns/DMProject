# Brain Tumor Predictor

This is a Machine Learning project which identifies Brain Tumor whenever a MRI scan image is uploaded into the software.
In this project we have used Custom CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) model for the prediction of the images.
After successfull training and testing,the frontend of the model was build using the streamlit library, then the app 
was deployed using the streamlit cloud platform.

## Dataset
The image Dataset was obtained from kaggle. The Dataset contains positive and negative images of MRI scans.
The Dataset contained 160 positive images and 90 negative images according to the model requirement.

## Working of the CNN model

This model has been trained on positive and negative Brain MRI scans.

![Positive image](https://github.com/shivampandeyvns/DMProject/blob/main/Y4.jpg?raw=true)
This MRI scan contains a Tumor, hence it is in the positive class of the images.

![Negative image](https://github.com/shivampandeyvns/DMProject/blob/main/3%20no.jpg?raw=true)
This MRI scan does not contain a Tumor, hence it is in the negative class of the images.


Upon sucessfull dataset development, we perform a train-test split on the data and then train our model for the prediction of these 2 classes.
Model parameters and model performance info is given below.
